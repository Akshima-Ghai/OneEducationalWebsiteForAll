## Setup and Installation

A common issue many people may face while setting up the project:
Running npm install(or npm i) throws these errors -

<img src="./public/err.jpg"/>

This occurs due to the mismatch in the versions of node and npm installed on your local machine and the ones used in the project.

### Solution

1. Update NodeJS :
   Download the latest version of Node from it's official website -

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

This would overwrite the previous outdated version.

2. Update NPM :
   Open your terminal, type the following command and hit enter -

```
 npm install npm@latest -g
```

This would update npm to it's latest version available.

And you're done!
Run the following commands in the project directory to set up the project.

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
