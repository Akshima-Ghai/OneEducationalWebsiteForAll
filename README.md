- If I have to describe my project , in simple words , it would be an educational website , but not just that  , it would be the best website , a person or organisation can ever ask for . It will have many features  including VideoLectures , Theory/Notes , TestSeries , DataAnalysis of results , Blogs to motivate or for Guidance  , Attendance System and many more features. We would also deploy it , so that it can be a real-time working  project and it would help everyone to gain a lot of experience and learning curve for this project would also be  great . It would also have the best design which would make it interactive as well as attractive .

- This Project would start from scratch , so that each and every individual can participate and contribute and learn to the maximum extent .

- If a contributor , had contributed to this project and had put efforts in the same , it would also help them for their freelancing career , because similar websites are asked to build on the freelancing websites.

## Setup and Installation

A common issue many people may face while setting up the project:
Running npm install(or npm i) throws these errors - 

<img src="./public/err.jpg"/>

This occurs due to the mismatch in the versions of node and npm installed on your local machine and the ones used in the project.

### Solution

1. Update NodeJS :
Download the latest version of  Node from it's official website -

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

This would overwrite the previous outdated version.

2. Update NPM :
Open your terminal, type the following command and hit enter -

```
 npm install npm@latest -g
```

This would update npm to it's latest version available.

And you're done!
Run the following commands in the project directory to set up the project.


```
npm install
```   

```
npm start
```
