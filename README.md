# OneEducationalWebsiteForAll
1) If I have to describe my project , in simple words , it would be an educational website , but not just that  , it would be the best website , a person or organisation can ever ask for . It will have many features  including VideoLectures , Theory/Notes , TestSeries , DataAnalysis of results , Blogs to motivate or for Guidance  , Attendance System and many more features. We would also deploy it , so that it can be a real-time working  project and it would help everyone to gain a lot of experience and learning curve for this project would also be  great . It would also have the best design which would make it interactive as well as attractive .
2) This Project would start from scratch , so that each and every individual can participate and contribute and learn to the maximum extent .
3) If a contributor , had contributed to this project and had put efforts in the same , it would also help them for their freelancing career , because similar websites are asked to build on the freelancing websites.
