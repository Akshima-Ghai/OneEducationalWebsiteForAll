                The most important thing is that you want to learn something
                that interests you, because once you start learning, you’ll be
                with this topic for a while. Choosing something just because
                it’s popular or what others are doing isn’t the way to go
                because if you don’t have a true interest in it, you’ll lose the
                motivation to learn! Spend some time seriously looking into the
                different tech career paths before choosing one to go down.

                I usually tell most people to start by learning HTML and CSS,
                then move into learning JavaScript. The reason is that
                JavaScript is used everywhere: frontend, backend, and even to
                build mobile apps. It has many use cases, which is why I think
                it’s smart to learn.

                There are tons of online courses and useful resources on
                front-end and back-end development. Check out this in-depth
                guide about what it takes to be a front-end developer, the
                skills you’ll need, and the best places to learn. For back-end
                development, I recommend reading The Beginner’s Guide to Backend
                Development or this post on backend development skills.
